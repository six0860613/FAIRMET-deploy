Still, for the longtime music journalist and author of the new book Fashion Killa: How Hip-Hop Revolutionized High Fashion, there was a disconnect.\n\nThe anniversary celebrations, and the media blitz that accompanied them, “focused a lot on the old school, and we didn’t really see a huge emphasis on aesthetics and style, especially as it relates to luxury fashion.” Yes, classic images of Run-DMC in their Adidas tracksuits were everywhere, but with Fashion Killa, Krishnamurthy hopes to expand our understanding of hip-hop’s impact on and interplay with fashion beyond those much-circulated moments."

But after school, glued to MTV and BET, she’d follow the scene, and the fashion, watching Lil’ Kim’s “Crush on You” video on repeat. “The wigs and the fur, the makeup, just everything being so playful and fun and ostentatious!” she enthuses. “Imagine seeing those images over and over again for months on end. We were almost self-brainwashing and fully inundated with the style.”\n\nGallery Books Fashion Killa: How Hip-Hop Revolutionized High Fashion by Sowmya Krishnamurthy\n<i>Fashion Killa: How Hip-Hop Revolutionized High Fashion</i> by Sowmya Krishnamurthy\n$27 at Bookshop\nCREDIT: BOOKSHOP.ORG\nFor the book, Krishnamurthy spoke to a number of rappers and designers, including Nas, A$AP Ferg, Meek Mill, Dapper Dan, and Tommy Hilfiger. COVID pushed some of those interviews to Zoom, but she fondly remembers her in-person encounters, like chatting with Cam’ron while he was jewelry shopping right before his Verzuz performance. Or Pusha T telling her that “he actually gives away a lot of his clothes because his wardrobe is just too big. I’m like, ‘Tell me where that Goodwill is, and I will take those clothes off your hands if you need me to.’”\n\nThrough these firsthand accounts, Fashion Killa traces the way hip-hop style evolved over half a century: from rappers emulating luxury brands, with LL Cool J and Big Daddy Kane sporting Dapper Dan “knock-ups,” to serving as inspiration for said brands, to becoming, in many cases, designers themselves and defining luxury on their own terms."

      "content": "“I’ve got a good feeling I’m going to meet Kim Kardashian tonight,” said Jacob Elordi with a cigarette dangling from his lips. He had just strode onto a wraparound balcony at the Chateau Marmont. With the lights of Hollywood stretched out before him, the man who stars as Elvis in Priscilla looked like he might shake his hips at any moment. It was the Thursday night of GQ’s 2023 Men of the Year party, and the Aussie heartthrob was there to celebrate his leading role in our annual year-end issue.\n\nAnd he was most looking forward to seeing Kardashian, his fellow MOTY cover subject alongside Travis Scott. “The covers were all awesome,” Elordi said. “But I loved Kim’s cover. She looked so rad.” Soon enough, his feeling was proven correct. To get the evening started, GQ global editorial director Will Welch and his MOTY co-hosts—Elordi, Kardashian, Scott, and Tom Ford—gathered for an intimate dinner. (See more photos here.) Elordi and Kardashian sat next to each other at the long table in the penthouse.\n\nGQ’s first Men of the Year issue came out in 1996. The franchise embraces the most important and fascinating figures from the previous 12 months, the actors and musicians and entrepreneurs and filmmakers and designers and athletes and creatives whose work, in whatever medium, was definitive in our culture. (Despite the name, it is not a gender-specific thing.) And every year we throw a big party in Los Angeles to bring the people from the pages of MOTY together. This year, the evening was sponsored by Glenfiddich, State Farm, Spotify, and Google Pixel.\n\nAnd come together they did. As guests pulled up to the penthouse for a pre-dinner cocktail, many of them beelined for Past Lives director Celine Song to congratulate her on her debut flick. “I’m so honored,” Song told Olivia Rodrigo, who praised the MOTY subject’s Oscars-contending film. “Celine just made her first movie and she’s the belle of the ball,” added the musician and actor Jason Isbell. “I mean, she’s amazing. She popped out fully formed like she’s Townes Van Zandt or something.” Nearby, GQ designer of the year Jonathan Anderson consorted with Song’s husband, the writer Justin Kuritzkes. The JW Anderson founder and Loewe creative director designed the costumes for upcoming Luca Guadagnino films Challengers and Queer. Kuritzkes wrote both screenplays. “We saved each other’s lives” on these projects, said Anderson. Why? “Well, it was both of our first films!” said Kuritzkes. Post-strike, Hollywood was roaring back to life.\n\nAs dinner hit the tables, Welch rose to give a toast to Ford, whom he profiled in a career-spanning exit interview for MOTY. “I’ve already said quite a bit about Tom Ford in the magazine, and he said quite a bit back,” said Welch, who explained that he wanted to shout out Ford’s singular world of luxury and beauty. “One thing that I didn't get to in the piece was that I think Tom has this unique ability to combine sex and money…Money is the most boring thing—”"

      "content": "Fortnite has introduced its next big name to its “Icon Series,” which generally includes athletes, actors, musicians, content creators and other types of celebrities. The latest addition is none other than celebrated F1 driver Lewis Hamilton — available for a limited time as either a standalone skin or bundle package.\n\nNotably, the skins are devoid of any Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team branding and instead embrace another element Hamilton is known for, his style. One of the two skins features the famed driver in a black or charcoal grey pants and jacket set that is accented with vibrant yellow and pink motifs that appear like lightning. Accessories on this skin include a beaded necklace, sunglasses, a single earring, a ring and a watch — with plenty of exposed tattoos.\n\nThe other skin available as part of the bundle pack takes on more of an F1 inspiration, with full body coverage from the head to the toes in a sleek armored black look with purple and yellow accents. The look also is highly reminiscent of Black Panther’s armor, featuring small ears at the top of the full-coverage helmet.\n\nAlso making a debut is Hamilton’s bulldog Roscoe, who is present in two of the five items in the bundle. In addition to Roscoe on a jet-powered surfboard or skyboard for that matter, is an energy-powered sword. In total, the pack includes the two skins, back bling, glider and PICKaxe for 2,400 V Bucks or 2,000 V Bucks for the singular skin, all of which is available now in the game.\n\nSee the Lewis Hamilton Icon Series Fortnite skin in action in the official trailer below."

      "content": "Dune: Part 2 is coming to theaters a little sooner than expected. The news of the new release date for the highly anticipated sequel comes after Universal moved Ryan Gosling’s The Fall Guy premiere from May to March of next year.\n\nThe second part of Dune is slated to move up a couple of weeks, though the new release date may be little solace to fans who had expected the project to open earlier this month. However, due to the actors strike, it was delayed since Warners and Legendary did not want to release the film without stars like Zendaya and Timothée Chalamet are unable to promote it.\n\nDenis Villeneuve returns to direct the film once again. This film will see new faces like Austin Butler, Florence Pugh, Christopher Walken and Léa Seydoux join the cast. Rebecca Ferguson, Dave Bautista and Josh Brolin return alongside Zendaya and Chalamet. At CinemaCon in April, Villaneuve said, “Part Two is an action-packed, epic war movie. It is much more dense. We went to all new locations. I didn’t want a feeling of repetition. It’s all new sets. Everything is new.”\n\nDune: Part Two arrives in theaters on March 1, 2024.\n\nIn other entertainment news, watch the official Madame Web trailer."

      "content": "UPDATE: Just one day after R&B singer Casandra Ventura – a.k.a. singer Cassie – filed a lawsuit against Sean “Diddy” Combs”, accusing him of rape and ongoing physical abuse, the two parties have reached a settlement. The parties announced Friday evening that an agreement had been reached, though specific terms of the settlement remain undisclosed.\n\n“I have decided to resolve this matter amicably on terms that I have some level of control,” Cassie said in a statement. “I want to thank my family, fans and lawyers for their unwavering support.”\n\n“We have decided to resolve this matter amicably. I wish Cassie and her family all the best. Love,” read Diddy’s statement.\n\nStay tuned to Hypebeast for more updates as they surface.\n\nORIGINAL STORY: Sean “Diddy” Combs was sued by Casandra Ventura – the singer known as Cassie – in a federal court in New York on Thursday. In the suit, Ventura, a former girlfriend to Combs, alleges that she was raped by Combs and subjected to years of physical abuse during their relationship.\n\nThe suit details that Ventura met Combs around 2005 when she was 19 and the rapper was 37. Ventura alleges that Combs “exerted his power and influence” over the course of a decade.\n\nShe claims that Combs physically abused her, subjected her to “excessive alcohol and substance abuse” and trafficked her by forcing her to engage in sex acts with other men and filming it. Ventura also says that Combs raped her in her home after she attempted to leave him.\n\n“After years in silence and darkness, I am finally ready to tell my story, and to speak up on behalf of myself and for the benefit of other women who face violence and abuse in their relationships,” Ventura said in a statement to press.\n\n“With the expiration of New York’s Adult Survivors Act fast approaching, it became clear that this was an opportunity to speak up about the trauma I have experienced and that I will be recovering from for the rest of my life.”\n\nIn addition to Combs, the suit names Bad Boy Records, Bad Boy Entertainment, Epic Records and Combs Enterprises as defendants. Ventura claims that the physical abuse was witnessed by “Mr. Combs’ staff and employees of Bad Boy Entertainment and Mr. Combs’s related businesses,” but that his employees never intervened.\n\nCombs’ “vehemently denies these offensive and outrageous allegations,” according to his lawyer Ben Brafman.\n“Ms. Ventura’s demand of $30 million, under the threat of writing a damaging book about their relationship, was unequivocally rejected as blatant blackmail,” Brafman said. “Despite withdrawing her initial threat, Ms. Ventura has now resorted to filing a lawsuit riddled with baseless and outrageous lies, aiming to tarnish Mr. Combs’ reputation, and seeking a pay day.”\n\nVentura’s lawyer, Douglas Wigdor, says that Combs “offered Ms. Ventura eight figures to silence her and prevent the filing of this lawsuit.”\n\n“She rejected his efforts and decided to give a voice to all woman who suffer in silence.”"

      "content": "The way we get dressed every morning is as personal as it gets. There are outfit repeaters, vintage treasure hunters, and even emotional dressers. But while everyone loves a good fashion trend, here at InStyle, we're interested in the deeper stuff, too: the way jewelry makes us feel, the way a beloved coat can spark joy on a cold day, the way a pair of shoes can pull a whole look together. How I Get Dressed unpacks fashion routines, rituals, and go-tos — straight from the fashion tastemakers we love.\n\nThere’s nothing like some sisterly banter to keep things interesting — and no one knows that better than Sara and Erin Foster. The Foster Sisters (as they’re known online) have done their fair share of playfully roasting each other on Instagram, but their cheekily frank dynamic also acts as the creative force behind their fashion brand, Favorite Daughter.\n\nBorn from “many arguments over colors, fabrics, styles, and who should be the fit model” (their words, not mine), the line capitalizes on the Fosters' unique taste, brutal honesty with each other, and love for comfort and style. The resulting collection includes an array of thoughtfully considered clothes that focus on quality and wearability over trends and ego.\n\nThe name says it all. Favorite Daughter has grown into a low-key fave — both on TikTok, where creators praise their “perfect pair of jeans,” and offline, as seen on fashion girls like Olivia Palermo and Ashley Graham — since its launch in 2021. Most recently, the pair collaborated with subscription service Nuuly, where they are one of the company’s most-rented brands, on a capsule that remixes some of the sisters' most popular styles for fall. Standouts include a matching set with a classed-up tube top, a luscious corduroy jacket, and a pair of dark wash wear-with-everything jeans.\n\nTo celebrate the launch, we talked to Sara and Erin about all things style. Ahead, get their fashion hot takes, including the blazer they swear feels like pajamas and the trend they're leaving behind in 2024. Here's the Foster Sisters' How I Get Dressed."

So, to one person, they might think, Wow, you get a cashmere sweater for $300. But to another person, they're like, I'm not spending $300 on anything. We really want to be a brand that is accessible to as many people as possible, and if renting that piece makes it accessible for you, that's something we're really excited to do.\n\nSara Foster: We're trying to grow with the customer. These customers that are renting us right now — maybe they're renting a sweatshirt, maybe they're renting something else, whatever — but as they get older, and maybe they get a raise, or they change careers, and they can afford to own [Favorite Daughter pieces], we want them to be with us for the whole journey. So we love getting customers at all different inflection points.\nEF: And maybe that's how someone tests out the brand if they don't trust us yet. They want to see what the quality is like. It's funny because, you know, we did some exclusive pieces that were for Nuuly...\n\nSF: We did this Phoebe Bustier and pant for just regular Favorite Daughter, and then we switched up the fabric a little bit [for Nuuly], made it a little younger, and made the pants a little shorter.

Whether she's walking the red carpet with her gold underwear exposed underneath a sheer gown, or casually running errands in sky-high heels, J.Lo always goes for the glam. And when stepping out in Las Vegas, she turns it up even more. \nCase in point? On Friday, Lopez co-hosted a charity poker tournament in Vegas along with her husband, Ben Affleck, for his nonprofit Eastern Congo Initiative and she went all out with her style. For the occasion, J.Lo chose a daring cutout gown by David Koma that featured a sexy thigh-high slit and an asymmetric cutout stretching from her chest down to the opposite hip. The black dress also boasted a built-in choker that was covered in crystals, as was part of the bodice and hem. She carried a sparkly black clutch, and finished off her glitzy outfit with statement serpentine-shaped earrings and a smattering of silver rings. \n\nLopez's caramel-highlighted hair was worn down in loose waves with a middle part, while the rest of her beauty look included nude lipgloss and a bronzy glow. \nAffleck, for his part, wore a bold blue suit with a white button-down underneath and black dress shoes.\n\n We Found Jennifer Lopez’s Exact Wide-Leg Jeans From Frame for 30% Off\nVegas, of course, is a special place for Bennifer as the couple tied the knot there in July 2022, eloping at the Little White Chapel. \"We did it. Love is beautiful. Love is kind. And it turns out love is patient. Twenty years patient,\" Lopez previously wrote on her On the J.Lo newsletter, adding that their ceremony was \"exactly what we wanted.\"\n\n\"In the end it was the best possible wedding we could have imagined,\" she continued. \"One we dreamed of long ago and one made real (in the eyes of the state, Las Vegas, a pink convertible and one another) at very, very long last.\" "

Because I had this image of Hugh Hefner.” Through his research process, Abdalla began to understand quite a different person from the one stamped in our minds. “The key to that was the interviews with his friends, where you began to get this image of a gentle, kind of shy, vulnerable, nice guy who had a very complicated but deeply loving relationship with his father,” he tells GQ, ahead of the release of the four-episode first part of the sixth (and final) season of The Crown.\n\nAs Abdalla began piecing together a more thorough understanding of this enigmatic character, he was anxious, unsure of what The Crown showrunner Peter Morgan had in mind for the portrayal of the Harrods heir. Was Dodi just going to be a shadow figure who's sort of irrelevant, the way he's been represented in mainstream culture, or is he going to be a figure who we get to know? “Immediately in that meeting, I understood that the plan was to give the Fayed’s an equal place in dignity and treatment like any other member of the royal family or as a family in their own right,” Abdalla says. “From there came the breadth of the sense of responsibility, both to Dodi as a person that has lived, breathed, and died 26 years ago, and to the cultural moment.”\n\nIn conversation with GQ, Abdalla breaks down The Crown's approximation of Dodi and Diana's final days, what it means to be misrepresented, and the responsibility that comes with playing this role.\n\nTo what extent do you think the real version of Dodi differs from the character you play in the show?\n\nThe major question I had to ask myself was did he or did he not have a falling-in-love with Diana? Did they fall in love with each other? My approach to all of that, which I've learned from the various different films I've done that have political resonance and importance in relation with real life, is that it's not our job to answer the questions around which there's a lot of speculation. It's our job to ask them as intensely as possible.\n\nBut doing so while tethering, wherever we can, to what is undeniable. Amongst those undeniable things for me, is the CCTV footage of them at the back of the Ritz. No one really sits there and watches the whole damn thing because why would you? It’s bloody boring, right? But at the end, there is this seven minutes of them, which when you watch second by second, is extraordinary. Diana is holding Dodi’s hand behind her back and they’re gently nuzzled into each other. Their heads touch from time to time, and they're just very gently caressing. From that, you understand the level of tenderness. No one is close like that without falling in love."

      "content": "There’s so much historical material to rely on to get Diana right, but it was difficult for you to find a recording of what Dodi even sounded like. How did you piece him together?\n\nHe died before YouTube. He died before the iPhone. There are so few pieces of footage in the public domain of him, and there was just this one interview that exists of him calling into Larry King where you hear his voice for 17 seconds and it's like, ah, that's it. The other really profound part of the research was his clothes. It was interesting, all the fabrics he wore had things that you wanted to touch. If there were things that were too shiny, too sharp, or repellent, that's not him. In many ways, the filming itself was also the process of research. It was an active research. You know the photographs in Back to the Future? I sort of had the inverse of that. I've grown up with all of these iconic images of Dodi and Diana, like we all have, and they're just images of things that happen to other people. But gradually, because they'd be up in the makeup trailer, I'd start to feel like I remember being there. I wore that shirt. I wore those sunglasses. These images started to become part of my life as if I’ve lived them, part of my family album. It’s been a great and deep honour, the whole process of making this.\n\nWas there a moment where you felt like you’ve fully grasped what he’s about?\n\nThere was this really key moment when I was beginning to understand him, I said to one of his friends: ‘I just really want to hug him.’ And she said: ‘That’s exactly how Dodi made people feel.’ You begin to understand who he is and then who to fight for inside the script.\n\nMost Popular\nThe best 4K TVs in the Black Friday sale for next-level movie nights\nLifestyle\nThe best 4K TVs in the Black Friday sale for next-level movie nights\nBy Simon Lucas\n\nWhen is Black Friday 2023 and how to make the most out of the sale\nShopping\nWhen is Black Friday 2023 and how to make the most out of the sale\nBy Owen Gough\n\nTen coolest things of the week\nLifestyle\nTen coolest things of the week\nBy Daphne Bugler\n"

      "subtitle": "No matter how much you drop on a watch, the same rules always apply to looking after it. Here's what the experts say you need to do to keep it in good condition",
      "content": "So you’ve secured your holy grail. Next, how to care for your watch? And more to the point, make sure you don't break it? Perhaps the biggest misconception in this enigma of an industry is that buying a watch means a lifelong partnership is guaranteed. It truth, like a marriage, it will take a little work.\n\nWhether that’s treating the crown with the sovereignty it deserves and not like a fidget spinner, or ensuring your pride and joy doesn't get dusty in a dish in direct sunlight, recite the below after us and you’ll find your partnership will last a lifetime.\n\nAll’s well and good when you’re out showing the world your new watch on your wrist, keeping the cogs whirring on with your physical movement for mechanical models. But watches have feelings too, and when you take your timepiece off, they don’t just go dormant. If four iterations of Toy Story taught us anything, it’s that there’s life outside of human sight. Tasked to remain as accurate as possible in the interim of sitting on our wrists, such a challenge means that storage is paramount in allowing your watch to do just its job well.\n\nConsider opting for a watch winder, which will keep your watch running by slow rotations on a turntable, eliminating any need to wind the watch yourself and extending the life of your timepiece too. That, and by safely storing it away, you eliminate the chance of knocking it off your bedside table. Because we all know how that will end up. Glass shards for days and heartbreak forever.\n\nTravelling with your timepiece\nConfession. When I first acquired my dad’s vintage TAG Heuer Monaco, I got so excited to take it abroad with me that I ended up packing it naked in a feral-looking make-up bag, coated with concealer and broken powder pots. To my shame, I arrived at my destination with a once steel-coloured model, now masked in skin-tone shades that clung to the lugs for dear life. Let my ultimate watch sin (so far) be a lesson to you on how to take your timepiece away with you.\n\nCare about the aftercare\nEveryone seems to groan at the mention of aftercare, but I can never fully fathom why. For those unfamiliar, it's the service provided after you’ve bought the watch, either direct from the brand or an external company. For some, it seems baffling that after a 5-10 year spell of taking on the world with your timely companion, it needs a little TLC. After all, you wouldn’t drive your car without an MOT, so why leave your watch behind? If you’re looking at a watch as an investment purchase too, the more you preserve it, the more money you’ll get back at the end, when you sign it over to another life. Of course watches are tested in the most mind-boggling methods; dropped from heights, shaken in circuits of 5000 rotations, placed into pressure chambers, and essentially put into stoves to test high humidity and temperatures. They’re designed to withstand the extremities of the world, but being human means there’s always going to be room for error. Why not negate the foolishness of you conducting your own at-home tests to see just how durable glass crystal really is and book yourself in for some aftercare love in between your doctor and dentist appointments? Consider it"
